This project explores naming trends in Armenia using two complementary datasets:

1. **[Armenian Election Dataset (2007 elections)](https://github.com/habet/random-insights/tree/main/armenian-name-frequencies/data)**  
   Contains the top 50 names of registered voters as of 2007, broken down by year of birth (latest birth year is 1989).

2. **[Official Statistics from the Statistical Committee of the Republic of Armenia](https://github.com/habet/random-insights/tree/main/armenian-name-frequencies/data)**  
   Provides annual lists of the 50 most popular names by sex. The data originates from press releases published by Armenia’s National Statistical Service, available at [armstat.am](https://armstat.am/am/?nid=134) - search for "անուն".
